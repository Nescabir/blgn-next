# About
So, this is a "refactoring"-ish of my [portfolio](https://github.com/Nescabir/blgn). It was using vanilla React and I wanted a bit more control, so I chose to use Next.

## What changed
- React -> Next
- CSR -> SSR

## What did I use
- Create-next-app
- Next 11.0.1
- React 17.0.2
- Typescript 4.3.5
- ESLint 7.31.0
- Sass 1.35.2
- Devicon 2.10.1
- Material-UI 4.11.3 (and it's lab package)
- React FontAwesome 0.1.14

### Others
- VSCode
- Next documentation
- Google
